;   - character order corresponds to position/direction-vectors
;   - the sequence begins with 12 o'clock and proceeds clockwise
;   - the characters represent the contents of the position
;       one unit of distance away from an origin piece in the associated direction
;   - the character will be "1" if that direction is occupied
;   - the character will be "." if that direction is NOT occupied
; values in this lookup table correspond to the keys as follows:
;   - values have one character for each of six directions

; TODO: there must be a function that describes this data more compactly
; OBSERVATION 1: there are repeats in this data, configurations that are merely rotations of existing data
; OBSERVATION 2: this data need not be represented with strings, but could be any data structure
; OBSERVATION 3: an input could be rotated up to 5 times to compare to existing configurations for a match, and then rotated back
; OBSERVATION 4: some of the data could be generated from existing data
; OBSERVATION 5: there is an underlying rule that was used to generate this data,
;   dealing with the fact that a "gap" must be of a certain width in order to allow a slide to take place
;   perhaps the answer is to measure the gap, and compare that against the predicted width of the shape that must pass through it
;   since there are only 6 slide directions, this seems like it might be more clean than listing every possible configuration
;   plus, I'm not actually 100% certain that all of these are correct; I believe that they're probably at least 95% correct
;   but since they were generated by a human (me), and not fully tested, errors might still be present
